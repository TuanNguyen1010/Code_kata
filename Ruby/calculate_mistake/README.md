For this Kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers together.

You may assume both integers are positive integers

|Input      | Output    |
|-----------|-----------| 
|1, 2       | 3         |
|0, 0       | 0         |
|16, 18     | 214       |
|26, 29     | 515       |
|122,81     | 1103      |
